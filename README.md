Transformer decoder model for S&P-tracked share prices.  By all reasonable metrics, no, it does not predict the market better than random chance because day-to-day price movements are more or less random given the information available at reasonable speeds to average retail traders.

Ever argued with a friend about why technical analysis for retail traders is ridiculous?  It can be exhausting talking about things that neither of you have any real idea about, even if you know you're right.  People will try to argue that they saw the "three line strike pattern," or that "the MACD is crossing over the SMA" or any other variety of ridiculous fortune-telling buzz-phrases.

But "AI" has become *the* buzz-word of 2024, and with this project hyprox Market Research is bringing bleeding-edge AI innovation from as recent as 2017 to tackle today's problems and synergize convergence to align low-hanging fruit with shareholder interests.

If the people who seriously believe in making money off of reading their star charts justify their arbitrary choices using "patterns," what better than AI to determine those patterns and help them out a bit?  And what better autoregressive model could there be to simulate such an exciting and ever-evolving system as the market than a transformer decoder?
In short, the answer may involve the word "stochastic."
